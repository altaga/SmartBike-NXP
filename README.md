## Introduction:

It is a fact that today the use of bicycles and other multimodal transport is increasing due to various reasons, including traffic, increase of awareness in global warming,etc... 

This is very good for the planet but it puts the users in a continuous latent risk when using it due to factors such as:

- Inadequate climate to exercise due to high pollutants.
- Fatal dangers by motor vehicles such as cars or public transport.
- Danger of falling or an accident due to the fact that the vehicle does not have a safety system for the user (bicycles, unlike cars, do not have an airbag or any protection, duh).

An integral platform connected by cell phone for constant weather monitoring, whenever the user suffers a fall or accident, it can effectively notify relatives or the corresponding authority (or emergency service) with only a button.

The solutions that exist today are SmartWatch based, which provide monitoring of distance traveled but do not provide an emergency warning system or real-time analysis of air quality.
